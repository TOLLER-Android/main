This folder includes original and modified versions of tools involved in our experiments. Note that WCTester is not available due to being proprietary software from its vendor.

See [here](https://github.com/TOLLER-Android/ape) for the source code of our modified version of Ape. You can also download a prebuilt Ape from [here](https://github.com/TOLLER-Android/ape/releases/download/release-20210725/ape.jar).

For related scripts see [`../useful-scripts/`](../useful-scripts/). Scripts are named in forms of `run-all-{TOOL_NAME}-{VARIANT}.sh` and `exec-{TOOL_NAME}-{VARIANT}.sh`, where the former form is for wrapper scripts that start the testing process in the background using scripts in the latter form.
