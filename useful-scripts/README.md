Script file names should generally be self-explanatory. If some script has special requirements (e.g., environment variables), they will be available at the beginning of the script.

Note that scripts in forms of `run-all-{TOOL_NAME}-{VARIANT}.sh` and `exec-{TOOL_NAME}-{VARIANT}.sh` belong to their corresponding tools.
